## Goals

Our over-arching goal for TidyTuesday is to provide real-world datasets so that people can learn to work with data.

- [x] For 2024, our goal was to be used in at least 10 courses. Our survey indicates that we are used in at least 30 courses!
- [x] For 2025, our goal was to crowdsource the curation of TidyTuesday datasets. We did not set a numeric goal, but many datasets were submitted by community members!
- [ ] For 2026, our goal is to provide tools for easier and better dataset curation. Ideally, this will have a numeric component soon.
